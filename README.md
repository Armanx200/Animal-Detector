Sure, here's a cool GitHub repository README for your Animal Detector project:

```markdown
# 🐾 Animal Detector 🐾

Welcome to the Animal Detector project! This repository contains code and resources for training a machine learning model to recognize 15 different animal classes and classify images accordingly. 

## 🦁 About the Project

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify the following animals:
- Bear
- Bird
- Cat
- Cow
- Deer
- Dog
- Dolphin
- Elephant
- Giraffe
- Horse
- Kangaroo
- Lion
- Panda
- Tiger
- Zebra

The model is trained on images stored in the `animal_data` directory, and can classify new images provided by the user.

- `animal_data/`: Contains subdirectories for each animal class with training images.
- `Animal-Detector.py`: Script to classify a new image.
- `Animal-Detector-model.py`: Script to train and save the model.
- `bear-1.jpg`: Sample image for testing.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary packages:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training the Model

To train the model, run:
```sh
python Animal-Detector-model.py
```

This will train the CNN on the images in `animal_data/` and save the trained model as `animal_classifier_model.h5`.

### Classifying Images

To classify a new image, use:
```sh
python Animal-Detector.py path_to_your_image.jpg
```

Replace `path_to_your_image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to classify. The script will output the predicted animal class and confidence level.

## 🐍 Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the classifier with the provided `bear-1.jpg` image:

```sh
python Animal-Detector.py bear-1.jpg
```

### Sample Output
```
This image is a Bear with 98.76% confidence.
```
